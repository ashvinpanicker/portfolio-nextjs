      <p className="mb-3">
        I've been passionate about tech since childhood, starting from hacking
        TV cables to tinkering with Arduinos and flashing custom ROMs. After
        earning my Computer Science degree, I began my career at a data
        analytics startup, where I discovered a love for frontend development
        and creatively visualizing data. I migrated the companyâ€™s legacy tool to
        a responsive PWA using ReactJS and d3JS.

        In 2018, I co-founded a Bitcoin startup, initially building a hardware
        wallet and later pivoting to a cross-platform mobile app using React
        Native and NodeJS. After successfully launching a Bitcoin
        Lightning-powered debit card in Europe, I transitioned to SuperProcure
        as a Senior Software Engineer, where I led the creation of custom
        analytics dashboards and managed a small team, while driving tech
        upgrades and streamlining processes.

        In 2023, I ventured into e-commerce, freelanced on projects like
        aquaoutback.com, and developed an AI chatbot for customer engagement.
        Currently, I'm a Software Consultant at Tailgrab Digital, focusing on
        React, Node.js, and MySQL. I'm passionate about emerging technologies in
        Fintech, AI, and AR/VR, and always eager to learn and innovate.
